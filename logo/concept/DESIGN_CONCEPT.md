# MOSAIC Logo Design Concept

## Overview
The MOSAIC logo is inspired by Ottoman architectural and artistic traditions, particularly the magnificent tile work found in the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne and the Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmed Mosque) in Istanbul. The design captures the geometric precision and vibrant beauty of Iznik tiles while maintaining modern SaaS brand standards.

## Design Inspirations

### Selimiye Mosque (Edirne)
- **Architect**: Mimar Sinan's masterpiece (1568-1575)
- **Inspiration Elements**: 
  - Geometric precision of the dome structure
  - 8-pointed star patterns (Rub el Hizb) found throughout the interior
  - Intricate tile work with perfect symmetry
  - Balance between grandeur and delicate detail

### Blue Mosque / Sultan Ahmed Mosque (Istanbul)
- **Era**: Early 17th century (1609-1616)
- **Inspiration Elements**:
  - Famous Iznik blue tiles (over 20,000 tiles)
  - Floral and geometric patterns
  - Cascading dome architecture
  - Border decorations with repeating motifs

### Iznik Tiles
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Deep cobalt blue (#1e3a8a, #2563eb) - the signature Iznik blue
  - Turquoise/cyan (#06b6d4, #22d3ee) - common in Ottoman ceramics
  - Gold/amber (#fbbf24, #f59e0b) - representing gilding and opulence
  - White background - purity and space

## Design Elements

### 1. The 8-Pointed Star (Rub el Hizb)
The central motif is the 8-pointed star, a geometric pattern deeply embedded in Islamic art and Ottoman architecture. This star represents:
- Perfect geometric harmony
- The intersection of two squares (rotated 45°)
- A common motif in both Selimiye and Blue Mosque tile work
- Balance and completeness

### 2. Geometric Mosaic Pattern
The logo uses multiple layers of geometric elements:
- **Central star**: Main focus, largest scale
- **Corner stars**: Creating symmetry and balance (like tile corners)
- **Diamond tiles**: Turquoise accents representing individual tile pieces
- **Circular frames**: Inspired by dome architecture and medallions

### 3. Typography
- **Wordmark**: Bold, modern sans-serif for "MOSAIC"
- **Subtitle**: "OTTOMAN HERITAGE" with expanded letter-spacing for elegance
- **Decorative bars**: Three-tier accent mimicking tile border patterns

### 4. Orkinosai Company Mark
- Geometric "OK" sigil enclosed in a circle
- Small star accent above for brand cohesion
- Subtle placement respecting the main brand

## Color Philosophy

### Light Mode
- **Primary**: Deep blues (#1e3a8a, #2563eb) - authority, trust, Ottoman tradition
- **Secondary**: Turquoise (#06b6d4, #0891b2) - energy, creativity, Iznik tiles
- **Accent**: Gold (#fbbf24, #f59e0b) - premium quality, heritage
- **Background**: White - clean, modern SaaS aesthetic

### Dark Mode
- **Primary**: Lighter blues (#60a5fa, #3b82f6) - maintaining visibility
- **Secondary**: Bright turquoise (#22d3ee, #06b6d4) - contrast and vibrancy
- **Accent**: Light gold (#fcd34d, #fbbf24) - warmth in dark environment
- **Background**: Dark slate (#0f172a) - modern dark UI standard
