# MOSAIC SaaS Platform

**MOSAIC** is a next-generation SaaS platform that empowers businesses and creators to build, manage, and scale multi-tenant websites with beautiful Ottoman-inspired design aesthetics.

## 🏛️ Heritage & Foundation

MOSAIC is built upon **OrkinosaiCMS**, a modern, modular Content Management System built on .NET 10 and Blazor. We've taken the solid foundation of OrkinosaiCMS and transformed it into a comprehensive multi-tenant SaaS platform while preserving its core architectural strengths:

- **Modular Architecture**: Plugin-based system for unlimited extensibility
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between Core, Infrastructure, and UI layers
- **SharePoint-Inspired Design**: Familiar concepts like Master Pages, Web Parts (Modules), and permission levels
- **Modern Stack**: Built on .NET 10, Blazor, and Entity Framework Core
- **Flexible Permissions**: Fine-grained, SharePoint-style permission system

### OrkinosaiCMS to MOSAIC Evolution

The transformation from OrkinosaiCMS to MOSAIC represents a strategic evolution:

| Aspect | OrkinosaiCMS (Foundation) | MOSAIC (SaaS Platform) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Single-tenant CMS | Multi-tenant SaaS platform |
| **Target Users** | Individual websites | Businesses and creators |
| **Architecture** | Modular monolith | Multi-tenant with tenant isolation |
| **Deployment** | Self-hosted | Cloud-native (Azure) |
| **Theming** | Generic themes | Ottoman/Iznik-inspired design system |
| **AI Integration** | Basic (Zoota chat) | Dual AI agents (MOSAIC + Zoota Admin) |
| **Payment** | Not included | Integrated Stripe + Microsoft Founder Hub |
| **Onboarding** | Manual setup | Streamlined sign-up with guided wizard |

## 🎯 Vision
